##Alienation
I feel a bit alienated from everything and everyone. I can barely speak anymore and most interactions I engage in go horribly. I have one friend that I can barely maintain and that&rsquo;s it.
Maybe it&rsquo;s my fault. Well, it is my fault. I&rsquo;m too detestable. Maybe even schizoid. Anyways, I say this to clarify this blog will be mostly me rambling. Might be therapeutic, who knows? Therapy is something that never worked for me." />

<p>##Alienation</p>
<p>I feel a bit alienated from everything and everyone. I can barely speak anymore
and most interactions I engage in go horribly. I have one friend that I can barely maintain and that&rsquo;s it.<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s my fault. Well, it is my fault. I&rsquo;m too detestable. Maybe even schizoid. Anyways,
I say this to clarify this blog will be mostly me rambling. Might be therapeutic, who knows? Therapy
is something that never worked for me. I am great at rationalizing all my antisocial behaviors and
my digustingly pessimistic thoughts that therapists have a hard time &rsquo;therapizing&rsquo;(therapisizing?) me.
Never had any breakthroughs going to therapy. Fankly, I feel like I&rsquo;m a lost cause. I probably won&rsquo;t
ever become more sociable, more happy, or even more &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; than I am right now. Sadly, I&rsquo;m
not quite any of these things right now. It would be awfully clichee to
compare myself to Grego Samsa, but, if you ever watched The X-Files, I&rsquo;m spiritually like that
tapeworm-human hybrid that came to live in the New Jersey sewers after crossing th atlantic in a russian ship leaving
Chernobyl. Wait, isn&rsquo;t Chernobyl in the countryside of Ukraine? Maybe I need to rewatch that episode.</p>
<p>##Tools of the Trade</p>
<p>I chose the cactus theme from the Hugo themes list because I feel uncomfortable looking at websites that are
over designed, websites in which things move around, or even worse: websites that try to get you to interact.
The best websites are simply well organized text. I&rsquo;ll still probably change the theme a bit since I really quite enjoy the
<a href="">monospace web</a> project and I would like to have this looking like it.</p>
<p>I should take the opportunity to speak about my latest adventures with
terminals tools and apps. I&rsquo;m writing this post on helix running on a tmux session and my current shell is the Nushell.
Wait, Nushell? I can hear you. Yes, it&rsquo;s pretty cool. I could never write more than 2 lines of bash without
screwing it all up, so it&rsquo;s nice having an actually usable scripting language in the form of nu. If you&rsquo;re familiar
with functional languages that use a lot of pipes/arrows to work on data, nu is one of those. It also looks really cool
rendering tables everywhere. Oh and I should say a few words about helix. I hear it being described as a successor/rival of
neovim, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite true. Really, helix is mostly a revamped Kakoune, a text editor no one has heard of.
But some one should have, since Kakoune likely is one of the best editors ever created. Except it is not a very convenient one,
and just like vim and emacs pretty much everything has to be configured to be usable. Helix is actually a Kakoune that
doesn&rsquo;t need a lot of configuration.</p>
