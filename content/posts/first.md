#First Post

##Alienation

I feel a bit alienated from everything and everyone. I can barely speak anymore
and most interactions I engage in go horribly. I have one friend that I can barely maintain and that's it.  
Maybe it's my fault. Well, it is my fault. I'm too detestable. Maybe even schizoid. Anyways,
I say this to clarify this blog will be mostly me rambling. Might be therapeutic, who knows? Therapy
is something that never worked for me. I am great at rationalizing all my antisocial behaviors and
my digustingly pessimistic thoughts that therapists have a hard time 'therapizing'(therapisizing?) me.
Never had any breakthroughs going to therapy. Fankly, I feel like I'm a lost cause. I probably won't 
ever become more sociable, more happy, or even more "comfortable" than I am right now. Sadly, I'm
not quite any of these things right now. It would be awfully clichee to 
compare myself to Grego Samsa, but, if you ever watched The X-Files, I'm spiritually like that
tapeworm-human hybrid that came to live in the New Jersey sewers after crossing th atlantic in a russian ship leaving 
Chernobyl. Wait, isn't Chernobyl in the countryside of Ukraine? Maybe I need to rewatch that episode. 

##Tools of the Trade

I chose the cactus theme from the Hugo themes list because I feel uncomfortable looking at websites that are 
over designed, websites in which things move around, or even worse: websites that try to get you to interact.
The best websites are simply well organized text. I'll still probably change the theme a bit since I really quite enjoy the
[monospace web]() project and I would like to have this looking like it.

I should take the opportunity to speak about my latest adventures with
terminals tools and apps. I'm writing this post on helix running on a tmux session and my current shell is the Nushell.
Wait, Nushell? I can hear you. Yes, it's pretty cool. I could never write more than 2 lines of bash without
screwing it all up, so it's nice having an actually usable scripting language in the form of nu. If you're familiar
with functional languages that use a lot of pipes/arrows to work on data, nu is one of those. It also looks really cool
rendering tables everywhere. Oh and I should say a few words about helix. I hear it being described as a successor/rival of
neovim, but I don't think that's quite true. Really, helix is mostly a revamped Kakoune, a text editor no one has heard of.
But some one should have, since Kakoune likely is one of the best editors ever created. Except it is not a very convenient one,
and just like vim and emacs pretty much everything has to be configured to be usable. Helix is actually a Kakoune that
doesn't need a lot of configuration.
